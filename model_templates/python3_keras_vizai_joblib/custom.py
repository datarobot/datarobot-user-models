def load_model(input_dir: str) -> Pipeline:

    Note: This hook may not have to be implemented for your model.
    In this case implemented for the model used in the example.

    This keras estimator requires 'load_model()' to be overridden. Coz as it involves pipeline of
    preprocessor and estimator bundled together, it requires a special handling (oppose to usually
    simple keras.models.load_model() or unpickling) to load the model. Currently there is no elegant
    default method to save the keras classifier/regressor along with the sklearn pipeline. Hence we
    use deserialize_estimator_pipeline() to load the model pipeline to predict.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_dir: str

    Returns
    -------
    pipelined_model: Pipeline
