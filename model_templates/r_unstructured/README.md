## R Unstructured Inference Model Template

This model is intended to work with the [R Drop-In Environment](../../public_dropin_environments/r_lang/).
or any other R environment as it doesn't require any specific packages.

The data is just a text file [unstructured_data.txt](../../tests/testdata/unstructured_data.txt).

The model doesn't use any artifacts, only `custom.R` which implements the `score_unstructured` method and performs a word count on the input data.

## Instructions
Create a new custom model with these files and use it locally in a virtual environment or with the R Drop-In Environment.

### To run locally using 'drum'
File paths are relative to `./datarobot-user-models`:   
`drum score --code-dir model_templates/r_unstructured --target-type unstructured --input tests/testdata/unstructured_data.txt`

#### Running with additional params
The following example shows how to control the types of the values passed into the `score_unstructured` hook.

Consider the following signature: `score_unstructured <- function(model, data, query, ...)`

##### Example 1
Command:   
`drum score --code-dir model_templates/r_unstructured --target-type unstructured --input tests/testdata/unstructured_data.txt --verbose`

Output:
```
[1] "Model: " "dummy"
  
[[1]]
[1] "Incoming content type params: "

$mimetype
[1] "text/plain"

$charset
[1] "utf8"

[1] "Incoming data type: " "character"
           
[1] "Incoming data: rough road leads to the stars \nчерез тернии к звездам\n"

[[1]]
[1] "Incoming query params: "
```
The `Model` value represents what is returned by the `load_model` hook.   
In this example, the content type was not specified so the default values are passed: `mimetype=text/plain` and `charset=utf8`. In this case, data is treated as text and passed as`character` into the hook.  
The query params are empty because the `--query` argument (optional) was not provided.

##### Example 2
The following example demonstrates a custom *textual* content type.  
DRUM handles `mimetype` starting with `text/` or `application/json` as a textual content type.  
Command:   
`drum score --code-dir model_templates/r_unstructured --target-type unstructured --input tests/testdata/unstructured_data.txt --verbose --content-type "text/my_text;charset=latin1"`

Output:
```
[1] "Model: " "dummy"  

[[1]]
[1] "Incoming content type params: "

$mimetype
[1] "text/my_text"

$charset
[1] "latin1"

[1] "Incoming data type: " "character"     
      
[1] "Incoming data: rough road leads to the stars \nÑ\u0087ÐµÑ\u0080ÐµÐ· Ñ\u0082ÐµÑ\u0080Ð½Ð¸Ð¸ Ðº Ð·Ð²ÐµÐ·Ð´Ð°Ð¼\n"

[[1]]
[1] "Incoming query params: "
```

In this example, the result is mostly the same; the content type params are `mimetype=text/my_text` and `charset=latin1`.  
The text is unreadable because it has been decoded using the `latin1` charset, while the input text file is encoded with `utf8` which is the default for Linux systems.  
> Note that in the most cases you are working with the text data with default encoding, or binary data. Otherwise you are responsible for properly handling encoding or decoding.


##### Example 3
This example provides a custom *binary* content type and query params.  
DRUM handles any data with `mimetype` that does not start with `text/` or `application/json` as binary.  
Command:   
`drum score --code-dir model_templates/r_unstructured --target-type unstructured --input tests/testdata/unstructured_data.txt --verbose --content-type "application/octet-stream" --query "ret_mode=text" --output out_file`

Output:
```
[1] "Model: " "dummy"  

[[1]]
[1] "Incoming content type params: "

$mimetype
[1] "application/octet-stream"

[1] "Incoming data type: " "raw"        
         
[1] "Incoming data: 72 6f 75 67 68 20 72 6f 61 64 20 6c 65 61 64 73 20 74 6f 20 74 68 65 20 73 74 61 72 73 20 0a d1 87 d0 b5 d1 80 d0 b5 d0 b7 20 d1 82 d0 b5 d1 80 d0 bd d0 b8 d0 b8 20 d0 ba 20 d0 b7 d0 b2 d0 b5 d0 b7 d0 b4 d0 b0 d0 bc 0a"

[[1]]
[1] "Incoming query params: "

$ret_mode
[1] "text"
```

The values are `mimetype=application/stream` and `charset` is missing as it was not passed, because not required for binary data.  
> Note: If you don't want to pass the textual mimetype so that DRUM can decode data,
> you still can pass mimetype for binary data and charset and decode the data yourself, e.g. `application/octet-stream;charset=<your_charset>`.
> This depends on the particular task. 

The data is treated as binary, so the type is `raw`.
The incoming query params are `ret_mode=text`, used in `custom.R` to output data as either str or bytes.  
Open output file `out_file`. It should contain text `10`, which is the word count for the data file.  

Now change `ret_mode` to `binary`. You will be unable to open `out_file` as a text file. On a Linux system, use the command `xxd out_file`. You should see `00000000: 0000 000a`.   
`0000 000a` - is 4 bytes, representing integer `10`.
