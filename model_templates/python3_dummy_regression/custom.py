    Can be used to load supported models if your model has multiple artifacts, or for loading

    This hook is only needed if you would like to use **drum** with a framework not natively

    Note: While best practice is to include the score hook, if the score hook is not present
    DataRobot will add a score hook and call the default predict method for the library

    This dummy implementation returns a dataframe with all rows having value 42 in the
    "Predictions" column, regardless of the provided input dataset.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : is the dataframe to make predictions against. If `transform` is supplied,
    `data` will be the transformed data.
    model : is the deserialized model loaded by **drum** or by `load_model`, if supplied
    kwargs : additional keyword arguments to the method

    Returns
    -------
    This method should return predictions as a dataframe with the following format:
      Regression: must have a single column called `Predictions` with numerical values
