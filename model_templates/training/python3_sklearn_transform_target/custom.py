    This hook must be implemented with your fitting code, for running drum in the fit mode.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X: pd.DataFrame - training data to perform fit on
    y: pd.Series - target data to perform fit on
    output_dir: the path to write output. This is the path provided in '--output' parameter of the
