# NOTE: In this model template DRUM is automatically loading "anomaly_juniors.onnx"
#
# Some hooks are omitted here as they are implicitly generated by the DRUM library.
# This happens because DRUM knows how to work with many known types of models.
# They can be overriden in order to change the default behavior:
#
# def load_model(code_dir):
#     ...
#
# def score(data, model, **kwargs):
#     ...
