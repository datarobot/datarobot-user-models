## Python Sklearn Inference Model Template


This model is intended to work with the [Python 3 Scikit-Learn Drop-In Environment](../../../public_dropin_environments/python3_sklearn/).
The supplied pkl file is a scikit-learn model trained on [boston_housing.csv](../../../tests/testdata/boston_housing.csv)
with a MEDV as the target (regression), though any binary or regression model trained using the libraries
outlined in [Python 3 Scikit-Learn Drop-In Environment](../../../public_dropin_environments/python3_sklearn) will work.

For this sample model, custom.py contains additional data pre-processing that the model itself lacks.

## Instructions
Create a new custom model with these files and use the Python Drop-In Environment with it

### To run locally using 'drum'
Paths are relative to `./datarobot-user-models`:   
`drum score --code-dir model_templates/inference/python3_sklearn --input tests/testdata/boston_housing.csv`
