    This hook is only needed if you would like to use **drum** with a framework not natively
    supported by the tool.

    Note: While best practice is to include the score hook, if the score hook is not present
    DataRobot will add a score hook and call the default predict method for the library

    This dummy implementation returns a dataframe with 0.75 probability for the positive class
    and 0.25 for the negative class, regardless of the provided input dataset.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : is the dataframe to make predictions against. If `transform` is supplied,
    `data` will be the transformed data.
    model : is the deserialized model loaded by **drum** or by `load_model`, if supplied
    kwargs : additional keyword arguments to the method
    In case of binary classification model class labels will be provided as the following arguments:
    - `positive_class_label` is the positive class label for a binary classification model
    - `negative_class_label` is the negative class label for a binary classification model

    Returns
    -------
    This method should return predictions as a dataframe with the following format:
      Binary Classification: must have columns for each class label with floating- point class
        probabilities as values. Each row should sum to 1.0
