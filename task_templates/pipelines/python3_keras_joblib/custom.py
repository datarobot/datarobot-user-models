    This hook must be implemented with your fitting code, for running drum in the fit mode.

    This hook MUST ALWAYS be implemented for custom tasks.
    For inference models, this hook can stick around unimplemented, and won’t be triggered.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X: pd.DataFrame - training data to perform fit on
    y: pd.Series - target data to perform fit on
    output_dir: the path to write output. This is the path provided in '--output' parameter of the
        'drum fit' command.
    class_order : A two element long list dictating the order of classes which should be used for
        modeling. Class order will always be passed to fit by DataRobot for classification tasks,
        and never otherwise. When models predict, they output a likelihood of one class, with a
        value from 0 to 1. The likelihood of the other class is 1 - this likelihood. Class order
        dictates that the first element in the list will be the 0 class, and the second will be the
        1 class.
    row_weights: An array of non-negative numeric values which can be used to dictate how important
        a row is. Row weights is only optionally used, and there will be no filtering for which
        custom models support this. There are two situations when values will be passed into
        row_weights, during smart downsampling and when weights are explicitly provided by the user

    Note: This hook may not have to be implemented for your model.
    In this case implemented for the model used in the example.

    This keras estimator requires 'load_model()' to be overridden. Coz as it involves pipeline of
    preprocessor and estimator bundled together, it requires a special handling (oppose to usually
    simple keras.models.load_model() or unpickling) to load the model. Currently there is no elegant
    default method to save the keras classifier/regressor along with the sklearn pipeline. Hence we
    use deserialize_estimator_pipeline() to load the model pipeline to predict.

    DataRobot will run this hook when the task is used for scoring inside a blueprint

    This hook defines the output of a custom estimator and returns predictions on input data.
    It should be skipped if a task is a transform.

    Note: While best practice is to include the score hook, if the score hook is not present DataRobot will
    add a score hook and call the default predict method for the library
    See https://github.com/datarobot/datarobot-user-models#built-in-model-support for details

    Parameters
    ----------
    data: pd.DataFrame
        Is the dataframe to make predictions against. If the `transform` hook is utilized,
        `data` will be the transformed data
    model: Any
        Trained object, extracted by DataRobot from the artifact created in fit().
        In this example, contains trained sklearn pipeline extracted from artifact.pkl.
    kwargs:
        Additional keyword arguments to the method

    Returns
    -------
    This method should return predictions as a dataframe with the following format:
      Classification: must have columns for each class label with floating- point class
        probabilities as values. Each row should sum to 1.0. The original class names defined in the project
        must be used as column names. This applies to binary and multi-class classification.
      Regression: must have a single column called `Predictions` with numerical values
