# model-metadata.yaml allows to specify task input/output requirements to help validate a blueprint where it's used.
# It's also valuable if you are using `drum push`
# see MODEL-METADATA.md and VALIDATION-SCHEMA.md for full explanations of fields
name: python3_xgboost
type: training # training (for custom tasks) or inference (for custom inference models)
environmentID: 5e8c88a407389fe0f466c72f # optional, only required when using "drum push" to select environment
targetType: regression  # can be one of: transform, binary, regression, anomaly, multiclass, unstructured (unstructured is only available for inference models)

# This part below defines the task's schema. Using this schema, on the fly,
# DataRobot will validate if the task requirements match neighboring tasks in a blueprint
# Note that it's only available for tasks, and not for inference models
# Every condition (and the whole section) is optional
typeSchema:
  # Specify what data types this task allows as input
  input_requirements:

    # specify what data types this task allows as input
    - field: data_types
      condition: IN # can be one of IN or NOT_IN
      value: # can be one or multiple of NUM, TXT, IMG, DATE, CAT, DATE_DURATION, COUNT_DICT, GEO
        - NUM

    # specify how many columns the task requires
    - field: number_of_columns
      condition: NOT_LESS_THAN # can be one of EQUALS, IN, NOT_EQUALS, NOT_IN, GREATER_THAN, LESS_THAN, NOT_GREATER_THAN, NOT_LESS_THAN
      value: 1 # non-negative integer value

    # specify if the task accepts data in sparse format (CSR format for python, dgTMatrix for R)
    - field: sparse
      condition: EQUALS # only EQUALS is supported
