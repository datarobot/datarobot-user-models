    """ This hook defines how DataRobot will train this task. Even transform tasks need to be trained to learn/store information from training data
    DataRobot runs this hook when the task is being trained inside a blueprint.
    As an output, this hook is expected to create an artifact containg a trained object [in this example - MissingValuesMedianImputation object], that is then used to transform new data.
    The input parameters are passed by DataRobot based on project and blueprint configuration.

    Parameters
    -------
    X: pd.DataFrame
        Training data that DataRobot passes when this task is being trained.
    y: pd.Series
        Project's target column (None is passed for unsupervised projects).
    output_dir: str
        A path to the output folder; the artifact [in this example - containing MissingValuesMedianImputation class object] must be saved into this folder to be re-used in transform()

    Returns
    -------
    None
        fit() doesn't return anything, but must output an artifact (typically containing a trained object) into output_dir
        so that the trained object can be used during scoring inside transform()

    -------
    pd.DataFrame
        Returns a dataframe with transformed data.
