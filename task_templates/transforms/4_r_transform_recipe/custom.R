fit <- function(X, y, output_dir, ...){
  "
  This hook defines how DataRobot will train this task.
  DataRobot runs this hook when the task is being trained inside a blueprint.
  As an output, this hook is expected to create an artifact containing a trained object, that is then used to transform new data.

  Parameters
  -------
  X: data.frame
      Training data that DataRobot passes when this task is being trained.
  y: vector
      Project's target column.
  output_dir: str
      A path to the output folder; the artifact [in this example - containing the trained recipe] must be saved into this folder.

  Returns
  -------
  None
      fit() doesn't return anything, but must output an artifact (typically containing a trained object) into output_dir
      so that the trained object can be used during transform.

# transform <- function(X, transformer, ...){
#   "
#   This hook defines how DataRobot will use the trained object from fit() to transform new data.
#   As an output, this hook is expected to return the transformed data.
#
#   NOTE: If fit() outputs a single recipe artifact, then you do not need to populate the transform() function. It
#   will automatically call bake as shown below. If your artifact is anything else, you must populate transform().
#   In addition, update the model-metadata.yaml file to reflect new input and output requirements.
#
#   Parameters
#   -------
#   X: data.frame
#       Data that DataRobot passes for transforming.
#   transformer: Any
#       Trained object, extracted by DataRobot from the artifact created in fit().
#       In this example, contains the trained recipe extracted from r_transform_recipe.rds.
#
#   Returns
#   -------
#   data.frame
#       Returns the transformed dataframe

#   bake(transformer, X)
