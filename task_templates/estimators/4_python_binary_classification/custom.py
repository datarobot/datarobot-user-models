# This custom estimator task implements a decision tree classifier

    """ This hook defines how DataRobot will train this task.
    DataRobot runs this hook when the task is being trained inside a blueprint.
    As an output, this hook is expected to create an artifact containg a trained object, that is then used to score new data.
    The input parameters are passed by DataRobot based on project and blueprint configuration.

    Parameters
    -------
    X: pd.DataFrame
        Training data that DataRobot passes when this task is being trained.
    y: pd.Series
        Project's target column.
    output_dir: str
        A path to the output folder; the artifact [in this example - containing the trained DecisionTreeClassifier] must be saved into this folder.
    class_order: list
        [for a binary estimator] a list containing names of classes: first, the one that is considered negative inside DR, then the one that is considered positive.
    row_weights: np.ndarray (optional, default = None)
        A list of weights. DataRobot passes it in case of smart downsampling or when weights column is specified in project settings.

    Returns
    -------
    None
        fit() doesn't return anything, but must output an artifact (typically containing a trained object) into output_dir
        so that the trained object can be used during scoring.

    Parameters
    -------
    data: pd.DataFrame
        Data that DataRobot passes for scoring.
    model: Any
        Trained object, extracted by DataRobot from the artifact created in fit().
        In this example, contains trained DecisionTreeClassifier extracted from artifact.pkl.

    Returns
    -------
    pd.DataFrame
        Returns a dataframe with scored data
        In case of classification, must return a dataframe with a column per class
        with class names used as column names
        and probabilities of classes as values (each row must sum to 1.0)
