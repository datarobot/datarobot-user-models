# In some cases, avg(prediction) might not match avg(actuals)
# This task, added as a calibrator in the end of a regression blueprint, can help to fix that.
# During fit(), it computes and stores the calibration coefficient that is equal to avg(actuals) / avg(predicted) on training data.
# During score(), it multiplies incoming data by the calibration coefficient.

# In this example we use a custom python class, CustomCalibrator, so that we can store the complex state inside the object and then re-use it during scoring.

    DataRobot runs this hook when the task is being trained inside a blueprint.
    As an output, this hook is expected to create an artifact containg a trained object, that is then used to score new data.
    The input parameters are passed by DataRobot based on project and blueprint configuration.

    Parameters
    -------
    X: pd.DataFrame
        Training data that DataRobot passes when this task is being trained.
    y: pd.Series
        Project's target column.
    output_dir: str
        A path to the output folder; the artifact [in this example - containing the trained CustomCalibrator class object] must be saved into this folder.
    row_weights: np.ndarray (optional, default = None)
        A list of weights. DataRobot passes it in case of smart downsampling or when weights column is specified in project settings.

    Returns
    -------
    None
        fit() doesn't return anything, but must output an artifact (typically containing a trained object) into output_dir
        so that the trained object can be used during scoring.

    -------

    model: Any
        Trained object, extracted by DataRobot from the artifact created in fit().
        In this example, contains an object of CustomCalibrator class extracted from artifact.pkl.
    
    Returns
    -------
    pd.DataFrame

        In case of regression, must return a dataframe with a single column with column name "Predictions".
