        -------
        X: pd.DataFrame
            Training data that DataRobot passes when this task is being trained.
        y: pd.Series

        parameters: dict (optional, default = None)
            A dictionary of hyperparameters defined in the model-metadata.yaml file for the task.
        Returns
        -------
        None
            fit() doesn't return anything, but must output an artifact (typically containing a trained object) into output_dir
            so that the trained object can be used during scoring.
