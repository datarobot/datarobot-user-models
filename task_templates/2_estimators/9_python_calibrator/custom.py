# In some cases, avg(predictions) might not match avg(actuals)
# This task, added as a calibrator in the end of a regression blueprint, can help to fix that
# During fit(), it computes and stores the calibration coefficient that is equal to avg(actuals) / avg(predicted) on
# training data
# During predict(), it multiplies incoming data by the calibration coefficient
