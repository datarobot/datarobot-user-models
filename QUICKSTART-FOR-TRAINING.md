# :bowtie: Welcome to Custom Training Models :bowtie: 
*NOTE*: This feature is currently in Beta. That means to get access to it, you 
need to reach out and ask us. Please email `sylvain.ferrandiz@datarobot.com` if 
you are interested. 

This is a quick start guide.

You should be able to complete this guide without deviating at all. If you 
cannot, let us know!

## Background
Custom Training Models is a new feature where you, a programmer, can write some 
code to build a model, and then have that model get built within DataRobot, 
show up on the leaderboard, and then be available for insights and deployment. 
Before now, the DataRobot Machine Learning Engineers were the only ones who 
could write new models in DataRobot, but that all changes, starting now. 

## Steps

### Get your environment set up
1. The first thing we need to do is to get a python environment working. This 
guide shows you how to do this one way, using pyenv. One way to install pyenv 
is to run `curl https://pyenv.run | bash`.
Check out the github repo for other manners `https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv`
2. Put the lines bellow on your ~/.bashrc file:

```
export WORKON_HOME=~/.ve
export PROJECT_HOME=~/workspace
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
```

3. Install a version of python `pyenv install 3.6.0`
4. Create a virtual environment `pyenv virtualenv 3.6.0 custom-training-models`
5. Now that you're in a brand new virtual env, we're going to go install the 
dependencies we need to test locally
```
pip install -r public_dropin_environments/python3_sklearn_binary/dr_requirements.txt\
 -r public_dropin_environments/python3_sklearn_binary/dr_requirements.txt
```
### Test that your code works locally
6. To do this, we're going to be using the tester tool developed by DataRobot 
engineers to make sure your model is in tip top shape to be uploaded into the 
app. This tool is called DRUM. Here's how to run it
```
drum fit --code-dir model_templates/training/python3_sklearn_binary --input \
tests/testdata/iris_binary_training.csv --target-type binary --target Species --verbose
```
This is going to build a model with the code in the `training/python3_sklearn_binary` 
directory, and then use that model to make predictions using the training data 
it fit with. 
### Upload your code into DataRobot
7. Now that we've made sure the model can run, it's time to add it into 
DataRobot. To do this, go to `staging.datarobot.com`. 
8. First, make a project with the data file we just tested the model with. 
Start the project in manual mode.
9. Make sure that the feature flag `Enable Custom Training Models` is checked 
off. 
10. You should see a top level tab called the `Model Registry` click on that, 
and then go into the custom model workshop
11. Create a new custom training model with the target type Binary. 
12. After this, drag and drop the contents of the code directory into the 
custom model file drop
14. Click on the big `Make Custom Blueprint` button
## Train your model
13. Now we can head over to the `Repository` tab, into the `Custom Blueprints` 
subtab
14. You should see the blueprint you just created. You can check the box next 
to it and then train it on your project. 

Thats it! This process has some rough edges still, but it will get easier and 
easier over time. Once your model is done training, you can check out how the 
model performs on the data provided by looking through the insights, or you can 
deploy the model as you would a normal DataRobot model.
