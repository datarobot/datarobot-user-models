    "# Building a Custom Task\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks through the general workflow for building a custom task. We'll also demonstrate how to then deploy your custom task to a cloud b\n",
    "\n",
    "## Note\n",
    "The final sections of this tutorial require that you have access to Cloud DataRobot (app.datarobot.com or app.eu.datarobot.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Agenda\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll learn:\n",
    "1. How to create a custom task using simple python classes\n",
    "2. How to test your python class\n",
    "3. How to use the drum cli tools to test out your custom task \n",
    "4. How to use the DataRobot API to deploy your custom task to the DataRobot cloud for use in projects\n",
    "5. How to insert a custom task on the DataRobot cloud into a blueprint\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup and Requirements [ In Progress]\n",
    "This tutorial assumes a few things about your filepath and prior work. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Firstly, you need a feature flag enabled:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, you should have a folder at the path `~/datarobot-user-models/`. If you put the folder in a different location, make sure you update the `TESTING_PATH` variable. This folder should contain 4 things:\n",
    "1. A folder containing your properly configured custom environment.     \n",
    "    In this example, it's named `public_dropin_environments/python3_pytorch/`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. A folder containing your properly-configured custom model.     \n",
    "    In this example, it's named `model_templates/python3_pytorch/`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. The current version of the DataRobot Python Client.\n",
    "    - Installation instructions for the client can be found here: [DataRobot Python Client Docs](https://datarobot-public-api-client.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/v2.20.0/setup/getting_started.html#installation)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. A test dataset that you can use to test predictions from your custom model.     \n",
    "    In this example, it's stored at `tests/testdata/juniors_3_year_stats_regression.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "It also assumes that you have access to app.datarobot.com.\n",
    "If you use another version of DataRobot - use appropriate credentials and URL.\n",

    "You may be wondering why we need to save our model only to immediately load it again to make predictions. The reason is that model training and prediction, also known as inference or scoring, are distinct tasks that may have very different resource requirements. As an extreme example, one of DataRobot's proprietary models is a genetic algorithm known as Eureqa. Training this model can take some time, as it iterates through hundreds, thousands, or even millions of mathematical transformations. However the output of this model is a simple mathematical equation, which can run almost instantly on very modest computational resources. So during training we want to allocate a high amount of compute, but while the model is making predictions, e.g. it is deployed and waiting to receive new data, we want a far lower amount of compute allocated.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The way we achieve this is by using Docker containers, which we can think of as extremely lightweight virtual machines. This allows our training container to have significantly different computational resources allocated than our prediction container. But since the training and prediction steps are in separate containers, we need a way to move trained models and other useful artifacts, e.g. class labels, between them. The solution is to write out the artifacts to disk, i.e. serialize them. So our save method at the end of training will write out the model to a shared file storage location and then our load method at the beginning of making predictions will read the artifacts into memory, i.e. deserialize them. \n"
