        DataRobot runs this hook when the task is being trained inside a blueprint.
        As an output, this hook is expected to create an artifact containg a trained object [in this example - median of each numeric column], that is then used to transform new data.
        The input parameters are passed by DataRobot based on project and blueprint configuration.

        Parameters
        -------
        X: pd.DataFrame
            Training data that DataRobot passes when this task is being trained.
        y: pd.Series
            Project's target column (None is passed for unsupervised projects).

        Returns
        -------
        CustomTask
            returns an object instance of class CustomTask that can be used in chained method calls
