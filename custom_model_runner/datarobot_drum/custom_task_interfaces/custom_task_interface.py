        This hook defines how DataRobot will train this task. Even transform tasks need to be
        trained to learn/store information from training data
        DataRobot runs this hook when the task is being trained inside a blueprint.
        As an output, this hook is expected to create an artifact containing a trained object,
        that is then used to transform new data.
        The input parameters are passed by DataRobot based on project and blueprint configuration.

        Parameters
        -------
        X: pd.DataFrame
            Training data that DataRobot passes when this task is being trained.
        y: pd.Series
            Project's target column (None is passed for unsupervised projects).
        row_weights: np.ndarray (optional, default = None)
            A list of weights. DataRobot passes it in case of smart downsampling or when weights
            column is specified in project settings.
