    This hook can be implemented to adjust logic in the training and scoring mode.

    This hook can be implemented to adjust logic in the scoring mode.

    load_model hook provides a way to implement model loading your self.
    This function should return an object that represents your model. This object will
    be passed to the predict hook for performing predictions.
    This hook can be used to load supported models if your model has multiple artifacts, or
    for loading models that drum does not natively support

    :returns: Object containing the model - the predict hook will get this object as a parameter

def transform(data, model):

    This hook can be implemented to adjust logic in the scoring mode.

    transform(data: DataFrame, model: Any) -> DataFrame

    Intended to apply transformations to the prediction data before making predictions.
    This is most useful if drum supports the model's library, but your model requires additional
    data processing before it can make predictions

    This hook can be implemented to adjust logic in the scoring mode.

    This method should return predictions as a dataframe with the following format:

    Binary Classification:
    Must have columns for each class label with floating-point class probabilities as values.
    Each row should sum to 1.0

    Regression:
    Must have a single column called "Predictions" with numerical values

    This hook is only needed if you would like to use drum with a framework not natively
    supported by the tool.

    :param data: the dataframe to make predictions against. If transform is supplied, data
        will be the transformed data.
    :param model: is the deserialized model loaded by drum or by load_model hook, if supplied
    :param kwargs: additional keyword arguments to the function. If model is binary classification,
    positive_class_label and negative_class_label will be provided in kwargs. If the model is multiclass
    classification (at least 3 classes), a class_labels list will be provided as a parameter.
