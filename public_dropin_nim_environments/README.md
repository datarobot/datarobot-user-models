 # Custom NIM Environment Templates
This folder contains templates for building NVIDIA NIM environments used in DataRobot.

In this repository, we provide several example environments that you can use and modify:
* [Llama 8B Example Environment](../example_dropin_environments/nim_llama_8b)
* [Running NIM as a Sidecar Example Environment](nim_sidecar)

These sample environments each define the libraries available in the environment
and are designed to allow for simple custom model environments to be made that
consist solely of your custom packages if necessary.

For detailed information on how to run models that work in these environments,
reference the links above for each environment.
